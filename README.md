# Time-Series-and-Forecasting
## Time Series Model

* Implemented a SARIMA time series model in python for Monthly Rainfall Data of the last 114 years in India. 

* Using the PACF Interpolation techniques, missing values were internally interpolated to maintain the full data. 

* Using the Dickey-Fuller Test, data was stationarized at first to implement the SARIMA model. 

* Using the Box-Jenkins Algorithm, predictive forecasting for the next month was achieved.
